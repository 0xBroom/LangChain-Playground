# Python Playground with Langchain Library

This is a private Python repository serving as a personal playground for self-learning with Python and the Langchain library. It provides a space for experimentation, exploration, and development of skills in natural language processing tasks using Python.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following software and dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.5 or higher)
- Langchain library
- python-dotenv

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```shell
pip install langchain
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Usage

Once you have the Langchain library and the necessary dependencies installed, you can start using them in your Python programs. Import the required modules in your Python script using the following lines:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
```

Make sure to load any environment variables using `dotenv` if required in your script.

Now you can freely experiment with the Langchain library and develop your own Python programs for natural language processing tasks.

## Examples

This repository provides a collection of example Python scripts that showcase the usage of the Langchain library. You can find these scripts in the repository's directories. Feel free to explore, modify, or create new examples to deepen your understanding of the library.
